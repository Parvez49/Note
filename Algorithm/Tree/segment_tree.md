## Segment Tree 
  is a data structures that allows efficient querying and updating of intervals or segments of an array. 
- It is particularly useful for problems involving range queries, such as finding the sum, minimum, maximum, or any other operation over a specific range of elements in an array.
- The tree is built recursively by dividing the array into segments until each segment represents a single element.
- This structure enables fast query and update operations with a time complexity of O(log n).
