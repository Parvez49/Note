### Dynamic Programming (DP):
 is a method used in mathematics and computer science to solve
    complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. By solving each
    subproblem only once and storing the results, it avoids redundant computations,
    leading to more efficient solutions for a wide range of problems.

### How Does Dynamic Programming (DP) Work?
 Identify Subproblems, Store Solutions, 
    Build Up Final Solutions, Avoid Redundancy. 

### When to Use Dynamic Programming (DP)?
    1. Optimal Substructure: Optimal substructure means that we combine the optimal results of subproblems to achieve the optimal result of the bigger problem.
