////////////////////Brute Force:

This is the most basic and simplest type of algorithm. A Brute Force Algorithm is the straightforward 
approach to a problem i.e., the first approach that comes to our mind on seeing the problem. More 
technically it is just like iterating every possibility available to solve that problem.

For Example: If there is a lock of 4-digit PIN. The digits to be chosen from 0-9 then the brute force
 will be trying all possible combinations one by one like 0001, 0002, 0003, 0004, and so on until we get 
the right PIN. In the worst case, it will take 10,000 tries to find the right combination.

The time complexity of brute force is O(mn), which is sometimes written as O(n*m) . So, if we were to 
search for a string of "n" characters in a string of "m" characters using brute force, it would take us 
n * m tries.


//////////////////////Greedy algorithms

AlgorithmGreedy(a,n) 2
// a[l:n] containsthe n inputs. 
{
	solution:=0;// Initializethe solution. 
	for i :=1to n do
	{
		x :=Select(a);
		ifFeasible(solution,x) then
			solution:=Union(solution,x);
	}
	return solution;
}
