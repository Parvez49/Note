### Sparse Graph:
 is a graph where the number of edges (EE) is much smaller than the maximum possible number of edges. E≈O(V)

### Dense Graph:
  maximum possible number of edges. can have at most O(V^2) edges.

### Hamiltonian Cycle or Circuit
 in a graph G is a cycle that visits every vertex of G exactly once and returns to the starting vertex.

### Hamiltonian Path
 in a graph G is a path that visits every vertex of G exactly once and Hamiltonian Path doesn’t have to return to the starting vertex. It’s an open path.
