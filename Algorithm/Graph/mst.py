ðŸ”¹ Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) Algorithms

A Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) is a subset of edges in a weighted, connected, undirected graph that:
âœ… Connects all vertices with minimum total edge weight
âœ… No cycles (forms a tree)
âœ… Used in network design, clustering, and approximation algorithms
"""


"""
ðŸ”¹ Primâ€™s Algorithm (Efficient for Dense Graphs)

âœ… Uses a priority queue (min-heap)
âœ… Grows the MST one vertex at a time, always adding the smallest edge that connects to the MST
âœ… Works best with adjacency list representation
