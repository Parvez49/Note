## cat
  - cat stands for concatenate â€” it is a standard Unix command used to display or combine file contents.
  - It reads files from start to finish, and prints their contents to the standard output
  - Example:
	- cat file.txt -> This reads file.txt and prints its content to the screen.
	- cat file1 file2 -> Concatenates two files and prints output.
	- cat > file.txt  -> Takes input from keyboard and saves to file.
	- cat (no args)	  -> Reads input from keyboard (stdin)
