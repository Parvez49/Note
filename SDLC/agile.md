Agile is a time boxed, iterative approach, to software development, 
to deliver the product incrementlly, instead of all at once.

Functionality --> Plan --> Implement --> Test --> Review

Review -- Satisfactory --> Yes --> build 
                       --> No  --> Plan 


## Coding Principles
1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Reduce code duplication and improve maintainability.
2. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Write code that is simple and easy to understand.
3. SOLID Principles (5 Object-Oriented Design Principles by Robert C. Martin)
   - S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class should do one thing.
   - O – Open/Closed Principle: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
