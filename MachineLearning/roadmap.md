2. Core Machine Learning Concepts ðŸ¤–

Algorithms

  - Supervised Learning: Linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees.
  - Unsupervised Learning: K-means, PCA, hierarchical clustering.
  - Ensemble Methods: Random Forests, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM).

Model Evaluation

  - Train/test splits, cross-validation.
  - Metrics: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
  - Hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization).
